📝 Notes Application (MERN Stack)

A Full Stack Notes Application built using the MERN stack — MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js.
This project allows users to create, update, delete, and manage notes efficiently with a modern UI and a secure backend.

🚀 Overview

I built this project to strengthen my understanding of full-stack development using the MERN stack.
The application is completely REST API–driven, connecting a responsive frontend with a powerful Node.js + Express backend, and a cloud-hosted MongoDB database.

🏗️ How I Built It
🔹 Frontend

Developed using React.js with Vite for fast development.

Styled the entire UI using Tailwind CSS, ensuring a clean, modern, and fully responsive design.

Managed data fetching and CRUD operations using Axios to communicate with the backend APIs.

Used React Router for smooth page navigation.

🔹 Backend

Created a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js.

Designed routes and controllers for CRUD operations on notes.

Connected to MongoDB Atlas using Mongoose for data storage and schema management.

Implemented proper error handling and used environment variables for secure configuration.

🔹 Database

Used MongoDB as the database to store notes efficiently.

Each note includes fields like title, content, and timestamps.

💡 Key Features

Full CRUD functionality (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS

API integration between frontend and backend

Clean folder structure and reusable components

.env configuration for environment security

Deployed-ready structure for both frontend and backend
